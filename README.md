# Design Pattern Studies

**Status:** Alive

This repository contains implementations of Design Patterns (or atleast how I understood them), with examples of random day-to-day contexts.

Where I study them:

* **Refactoring Guru**: https://refactoring.guru/
* **Geekific:** https://www.youtube.com/@geekific
* **(Brazilian) Renato Augusto:** https://www.youtube.com/@RenatoAugustoTech
